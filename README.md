### Game setup 
Number of players: 2 - 5  
Five cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck to each player, or seven cards if there are only two players.  
The remaining cards are shared between the players, usually spread out in a disorderly pile referred to as the "ocean" or "pool".

### Game flow - how to play the game
- The player whose turn it is to play asks any another player for their cards of a particular face value. For example, Player 1 may ask, "Player 2, do you have any eights?"
Player 1 must have at least one card of the rank they requested.

- Player 2 must hand over all cards of that face value they have. If Player 2 does not have the requested card, they would tell Player A to “Go Fish!”

- If a player is told to “Go fish!” they pull a random card from the center and add it to their hand.

- If a player gets a set of four matching cards, they must lay down the matched set immediately in full view of the other players.

- After a player is told to “Go Fish!” and selects their random card, their turn ends. If they successfully secure a requested card from another player, they get another turn.

### Game end
Play continues until one player runs out of cards.

### Winner
The game is won by the player who has collected the most sets of four like cards.
